# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

"This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, machine learning model building, evaluation, and deployment readiness. I am open to feedback and further improvements!"

## 📚 Objective
Develop a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions efficiently.

- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Engineer meaningful features such as transaction hour, rolling mean amount, and transaction amount difference.
- Train and compare multiple models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- Build a Streamlit frontend for real-time prediction and evaluation.
- Evaluate models using Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py
Upload Dataset:

Upload the creditcard.csv dataset (or your own transactions).

Choose a model to train (RandomForest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).

View metrics and evaluation results live on the app!
